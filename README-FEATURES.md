## üåê Enhanced Cloud-Based Inventory Sharing

### Overview
Real-time collaborative inventory management that allows multiple users to share and synchronize medicine collections instantly.

### Features
- **Real-Time Sync**: Changes appear instantly for all connected users
- **Share Codes**: Easy 8-character codes for joining shared inventories

- **Auto-Sync**: Automatic synchronization when online
- **Offline Support**: Works offline with sync when connection returns

### How to Use
1. **Create Shared Inventory**: Click "Create New Shared Inventory" 
2. **Share Code**: Share the generated code with family/colleagues
3. **Join Existing**: Enter a share code to join someone else's inventory
4. **Real-Time Updates**: Add/edit/delete medicines and see changes sync instantly
5. **Collaborate**: Multiple people can manage the same inventory simultaneously

### Share Code Example
```
Share Code: HM8K9P2L

```

## üîß Technical Implementation

### AI Integration Support
The app includes placeholders for external AI APIs:

#### Supported AI Services
- **xAI Grok API** (Recommended for homeopathic analysis)
- **OpenAI GPT API** (Alternative option)

#### Setup Instructions
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Add your AI API key:
   ```
   AI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   AI_API_ENDPOINT=https://api.x.ai/v1/analyze
   ```

### Cloud Database Support
Real-time sharing uses Firebase for live synchronization:

#### Firebase Setup
1. Create a Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Enable Realtime Database
3. Add your credentials to `.env`:
   ```
   FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_key
   FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
   FIREBASE_ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY="your_private_key"
   FIREBASE_ADMIN_CLIENT_EMAIL=your_service_account_email
   ```

### Fallback Behavior
- **No AI API**: Uses classical homeopathic database matching
- **No Firebase**: Uses PostgreSQL-only sharing (manual refresh needed)
- **Offline Mode**: Local-only functionality with sync when online

## üé® UI/UX Enhancements

### Design Elements
- **Calming Color Palette**: Purple/indigo gradients (#E6F0FA background, #4CAF50 accents)
- **Confidence Indicators**: Visual badges showing match percentages
