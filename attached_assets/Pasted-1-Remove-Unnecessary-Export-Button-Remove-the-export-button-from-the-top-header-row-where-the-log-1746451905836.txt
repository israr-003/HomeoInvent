1. Remove Unnecessary Export Button
Remove the export button from the top header row (where the logo appears).

It is not required anymore since export is already handled elsewhere.


2. Fix Incorrect Low Stock Display in Pie Chart
In the analytics pie chart, when 1 bottle is in stock, it should not be shown as low stock.

Low stock should only trigger when quantity = 0.

3. Improve UI/UX and Interactions
Enhance the color scheme

Add glow/hover animations

Use modern fonts and smooth transitions

Overall design should feel premium and intuitive

4. Excel File Import – What’s the Issue?
Problem:
Most users (including you) are not uploading the Excel file in a strict predefined format like:

Name
Potency
Company
Quantity
Location
Bottle Size
But the app expects exact column headers and structure. If it doesn’t match, the app fails to read and import the data properly.

Fix Suggestion:

Use smart detection: Auto-detect column headers based on keywords like:

“Arnica 30” → split into Name = Arnica, Potency = 30
“Masood” or “Kent” → detect as Company
Add a preview step after upload to let user map fields manually (like Google Forms does).
Allow import from both .xlsx and .csv files.

5. Family Access to Medicine Stock
Problem:
Your family installs the app but they don’t automatically see the shared inventory. Right now, there's no system for sharing access between devices or users.

Fix Suggestion:

Add an “Add Family Member” button in settings.
You (owner) can:

Share access by generating a unique access code or link
Set permissions: View-only / Edit
On the family member’s app:

They paste the code or open the shared link → access granted
No login system needed; just link-based sync with your local data or simple Firebase DB.


Feature Fix & Enhancement Request

Fix Excel Import Logic:

Right now the app expects a strict Excel format.
Instead, enable smart column detection or a manual mapping screen after upload.
Example: split “Arnica 30” into name and potency automatically.
Support both .xlsx and .csv formats.
Show a preview before final import.
Family Member Access System:

Add an “Add Family Member” option in settings.
Generate a unique access link or code that can be:

Shared with others
Used to sync the same medicine stock on other devices
Allow owner to set permissions (view or edit).
No login system; use lightweight link-based sync.
