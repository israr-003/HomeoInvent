🔄 Final Feature Upgrade Request for Home Medicine Inventory App
Please implement both optional cloud sync and local backup options to ensure data isn't lost if the app is deleted or the device is changed.

🔐 1. Optional Login & Cloud Sync
Add Google/email login (using Firebase, Supabase, or any lightweight auth).

Make login completely optional – app should still work offline.

When signed in:

Data auto-syncs to cloud.

If user logs in on a new device, all data restores.

Allow option to share data with family members:

Via link, invite, or QR code.

Set access level: View only / View & Edit.

💾 2. Export & Import (Local Database Backup)
Add a clear “Backup Data” button: exports all medicines to .json or .xlsx.

Add “Restore Backup” or “Import File” option.

If column names don’t match during import:

Show a column-mapping dropdown like in MySQL.

User selects which file column maps to which app field.

If a column is missing, skip and allow adding later.

✅ Handle partial data gracefully and avoid errors like:
“The uploaded file is empty or contains only headers”
<Select.Item /> must have a non-empty value
Even if only a few columns are present (like: Name + Potency, Quantity, Company, Area) — app should accept and adapt.

🎨 UI Suggestions for This Flow
Backup & Import UI:
Use a card-style layout with soft shadows and icons.

“Export Backup” and “Import File” in a dropdown or FAB button.

During import, display a step-by-step wizard:

Step 1: Upload file

Step 2: Map columns

Step 3: Preview & Confirm

Cloud Login UI:
Add a simple login modal or slide-in drawer.

After login, show “Your data is synced” indicator.

Add “Invite Family” button to manage access.

General UI Improvements:
Improve color contrast on theme toggle button (hover text and icon visibility).

Auto-suggest previously entered storage locations to avoid retyping.

Add smooth hover animations, glowing effects, and modern fonts.

Keep the layout clean, mobile-first, and intuitive.

🧪 Optional but Helpful:
Add a test/demo file upload for new users.

Offer a “What’s New” tooltip or onboarding guide on update.
