Here’s a **detailed and clear prompt** you can give to the Replit developer or system to explain the **import issue completely** — including both Excel and CSV problems, and the required fix:

🚨 **Final Fix: Excel/CSV Import Problem**
**Description**: I'm facing a critical issue when uploading Excel or CSV files in my medicine inventory app. This is the only thing left to fix.

### ❌ Current Errors:

1. **Excel File Error**:

   > “The uploaded file is empty or contains only headers”
   > Even though the file has proper data, it throws this error just because some columns are missing or headers aren’t exactly matching.

2. **CSV File Error**:

   > `[plugin:runtime-error-plugin] A <Select.Item /> must have a value prop that is not an empty string.`
   > This happens when the dropdown for column mapping doesn’t handle empty values correctly.

---

### ✅ Expected Behavior:

* The system should **read all rows**, even if column headers don’t match the database fields exactly.
* Show a **column mapping screen** like MySQL import:

  * Let the user manually map columns from the file to internal fields (e.g., "Name", "Quantity", etc.).
  * Show dropdowns with available file columns.
  * Allow skipping unrecognized fields without crashing.
* If a user doesn’t assign a mapping to one field, **just ignore that column**, don’t block the whole import.
* Avoid runtime crashes by ensuring no `<Select.Item>` has an empty `value`.

### 📎 Example File:

My Excel file has these columns:

```
Medicine Name | Current Quantity | Company | Area
```

But some columns like potency or category are missing. Still, the app should be able to:

* Detect and allow manual mapping of these available fields.
* Import whatever data is provided.
* Skip or leave empty anything not included.

💡 Please update the import system to handle partial data gracefully and use dynamic mapping to match columns.

This is urgent and my final credit. Thank you.
