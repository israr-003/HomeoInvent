## Technical Implementation

### Component Structure
```
improved-learning-assistant.tsx
├── Main Component Container
├── Stylish Header with Animations
├── Enhanced Tab Navigation
├── Sticky Search Bar with Scroll Behavior
├── Medicine Grid with Cards
├── "See More" Button for Incremental Loading
├── Medicine Details Modal with Proper Scrolling
└── Quiz System in Separate Tab
```

### Key Features

#### Sticky Search Bar with Scroll Behavior
The search bar now intelligently hides when scrolling down and reappears when scrolling up, using the following scroll detection logic:

```javascript
const handleScroll = () => {
  if (!scrollContainerRef.current) return;
  
  const currentScrollY = scrollContainerRef.current.scrollTop;
  
  if (currentScrollY > 100) { // Only apply after scrolling down a bit
    if (currentScrollY > lastScrollY + 10) {
      // Scrolling down - hide search bar
      setSearchBarVisible(false);
    } else if (currentScrollY < lastScrollY - 10) {
      // Scrolling up - show search bar
      setSearchBarVisible(true);
    }
  } else {
    // At the top - always show search bar
    setSearchBarVisible(true);
  }
  
  setLastScrollY(currentScrollY);
};
```

#### Improved Medicine Details Modal
The medicine details modal has been enhanced with proper scrolling and better organization:

```javascript
<ScrollArea className="flex-1 p-4 overflow-y-auto max-h-[calc(85vh-120px)]">
  <div className="space-y-4">
    {/* Section content here */}
  </div>
</ScrollArea>
```

#### CSS Enhancements
New CSS classes were added to handle the scroll behavior and animations:

```css
/* Sticky search bar with scroll behavior */
.search-bar-container {
  transition: transform 0.3s ease, opacity 0.3s ease, backdrop-filter 0.3s ease;
}

.search-bar-hidden {
  transform: translateY(-100%);
  opacity: 0;
}

.search-bar-visible {
  transform: translateY(0);
  opacity: 1;
  backdrop-filter: blur(8px);
}

/* Fade-in animation for title */
@keyframes fadeIn {
  from { opacity: 0; }
  to { opacity: 1; }
}

.animate-fadeIn {
  animation: fadeIn 0.8s ease-out forwards;
}
```

## Usage

To use the improved Learning Assistant, import the component and provide it with medicine data and quiz questions:

```javascript
import ImprovedLearningAssistant from "@/components/improved-learning-assistant";

// Inside your component
return (
  <ImprovedLearningAssistant 
    medicines={ALL_MEDICINES}
    quizQuestions={QUIZ_QUESTIONS}
  />
);
```
