#### Example Database Queries
```sql
-- Add a new medicine to inventory
INSERT INTO medicines (name, potency, company, location, quantity)
VALUES ('Belladonna', '30C', 'Boiron', 'Medicine Cabinet', 2);

-- Find all medicines in a specific location
SELECT * FROM medicines 
WHERE location = 'Medicine Cabinet' 
ORDER BY name;

-- Share inventory with family
INSERT INTO shared_inventories (inventory_id, inventory_data, owner_id)
VALUES ('FAM123', '[{"name":"Arnica","potency":"200C"}]', 'user456');
```

## Implementation Details

### How the Database is Used

#### 1. Data Storage Strategy
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL hosted on cloud (Neon) for reliability and scalability
- **Local Storage**: IndexedDB in browser for offline functionality
- **Synchronization**: Automatic sync between local and cloud storage when online

#### 2. ORM Implementation (Drizzle)
Instead of writing raw SQL queries, the application uses Drizzle ORM for:
- **Type Safety**: Automatic TypeScript types for all database operations
- **Query Building**: Programmatic query construction with IntelliSense support
- **Schema Management**: Automatic database schema updates
- **Validation**: Built-in data validation using Zod schemas

Example ORM Usage:
```typescript
// Instead of raw SQL, we use type-safe ORM queries
const userMedicines = await db.query.medicines.findMany({
  where: eq(medicines.location, 'Medicine Cabinet'),
  orderBy: asc(medicines.name)
});
```

#### 3. Data Validation
Every piece of data is validated before entering the database:
```typescript
// Validation schema for medicine data
export const insertMedicineSchema = createInsertSchema(medicines, {
  name: (schema) => schema.min(2, "Medicine name must be at least 2 characters"),
  potency: (schema) => schema.min(1, "Potency is required"),
  quantity: (schema) => schema.min(0, "Quantity cannot be negative"),
});
```

#### 4. API Route Structure
The backend provides RESTful API endpoints for all database operations:
- `GET /api/medicines` - Retrieve all medicines
- `POST /api/medicines` - Add new medicine
- `PUT /api/medicines/:id` - Update existing medicine
- `DELETE /api/medicines/:id` - Remove medicine
- `GET /api/remedies` - Get learning content
- `POST /api/progress` - Update learning progress

#### 5. Real-time Features
- **Instant Search**: Database queries optimized for fast search results
- **Auto-save**: Changes are automatically saved to prevent data loss
- **Live Updates**: Multiple users can see inventory changes in real-time

#### 6. Data Export System
The application provides comprehensive export functionality:
- **JSON Export**: Complete database backup in JSON format
- **SQL Dump**: Raw SQL file for database restoration
- **Excel Reports**: Formatted spreadsheets for inventory management
- **PDF Reports**: Professional reports for documentation

#### 7. Security and Privacy
- **Input Sanitization**: All user input is cleaned and validated
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: ORM automatically prevents SQL injection attacks
- **Secure Sharing**: Family sharing uses randomly generated secure codes
- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data is encrypted before storage
